# WeatherMate

## Overview

This project is my implementation of the Clima weather app that was built while following "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp using Dart" by the London App Brewery and Angela Yu on LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-08-powering-your-app-with-live-web-data). This weather app is powered by live weather data pulled from the Open Weather Map api (https://openweathermap.org/).
